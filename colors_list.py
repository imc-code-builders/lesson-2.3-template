# 1. Create a list called "colors_list" containing the colors "blue", "red", "yellow", "green", "blue".


# 2. Create a set named "colors_set" by passing "colors_list" to the the `set()` constructor.


# 3. Print "colors_set" to make sure the duplicate colors have been de-duplicated.


# 4. Add "purple" and "pink" to "colors_set".


# 5. Remove "yellow" from the set.


# 6. Print the final "colors_set".


# BONUS: try removing the color "orange" from the set. What happens?
