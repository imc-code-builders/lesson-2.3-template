# 1. Create a set with 5 different numbers between 1 and 20.


# 2. Create an infinite loop. Inside the loop:


    # 3. Read in a number from the user input.


    # 4. If the user's number is in the set, remove the number from the set and print "Hooray! <user's number> is in the set"


    # 5. If the user's number is NOT in the set, print "<user's number> is not in the set :("


    # 6. If there are no more numbers in the set, print "You guessed all the numbers!" and exit the program.


# BONUS: If the user does not guess all the numbers in 10 tries, print "You did not guess all the numbers :(" and exit the program.
