# 1. Create an empty list called “playlist”.


# 2. Create an empty set called "unique_songs".


# 3. Create an infinite loop. Inside the loop:


    # 4. Read the name of a song from user input.


    # 5. Check if the song exists in "unique_songs". If so, print "You've already added this song to the playlist!" and `continue` to the next loop iteration.


    # 6. Add the song to both "playlist" and "unique_songs".


    # 7. Print the contents of "playlist".

CHALLENGE! (Finish the above steps first).

Update your code to support multiple playlists!
- Inside your loop, update your code to read two user inputs: 1) the name of the song, and 2) the name of the playlist where the song should be added.
- Consider using a combination of sets/lists/dictionaries to map a single playlist name to the songs in the playlist.

If you don't know where to start, ask a mentor!
